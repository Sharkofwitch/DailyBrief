# DailyBrief

DailyBrief is a web application that collects and visualizes the most important global news every morning. The app can either display the news directly on a web page or send them via email. It's designed to be a simple yet powerful tool to stay informed about current events.

## Features

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the app locally using the following command:

### Setting up the Web Scraper

To ensure the scraper collects the latest news, you need to configure it. You can adjust the scraper settings in `scraper.js` to specify which news sources you want to track and how frequently it should run.

### Email Notification (optional)

If you want to send the news via email, configure your email provider settings in `config/email.js`. Youâ€™ll need to provide SMTP credentials to enable email functionality.
